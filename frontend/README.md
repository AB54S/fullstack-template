# FastAPI Project - Frontend

The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

* Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173/.

Notice that this live server is not running inside Docker, it's for local development, and that is the recommended workflow. Once you are happy with your frontend, you can build the frontend Docker image and start it, to test it in a production-like environment. But building the image at every change will not be as productive as running the local development server with live reload.

Check the file `package.json` to see other available options.

## Generate Client

### Automatically

* Activate the backend virtual environment.
* From the top level project directory, run the script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

* Commit the changes.

### Manually

* Start the backend API locally or in Minikube and make sure OpenAPI is reachable.

* Download OpenAPI JSON from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` and copy it to `frontend/openapi.json`.

* To generate the frontend client, run:

```bash
bun run generate-client
```

* Commit the changes.

Notice that everytime the backend changes (changing the OpenAPI schema), you should follow these steps again to update the frontend client.

## Using a Remote API

If you want to use a remote API, you can set the environment variable `API_URL` to the URL of the remote API. For example, you can set it in the `frontend/.env` file:

```env
API_URL=https://api.my-domain.example.com
```

Then, when you run the frontend, it will use that URL as the base URL for the API.

## Code Structure

The frontend code is structured as follows:

* `frontend/src` - The main frontend code.
* `frontend/src/assets` - Static assets.
* `frontend/src/client` - The generated OpenAPI client.
* `frontend/src/components` -  The different components of the frontend.
* `frontend/src/hooks` - Custom hooks.
* `frontend/src/routes` - The different routes of the frontend which include the pages.

## End-to-End Testing with Playwright

The frontend includes initial end-to-end tests using Playwright. Start backend and frontend first, then run:

```bash
bunx playwright test
```

You can also run tests in UI mode:

```bash
bunx playwright test --ui
```

To update the tests, navigate to the tests directory and modify the existing test files or add new ones as needed.

For more information on writing and running Playwright tests, refer to the official [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
